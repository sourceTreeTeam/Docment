# Writing Standard

:tada: :100:
::: tip
① Interface documents use swagger
② The author must strictly abide by the tslint writing rules in the project
③ The author must strictly follow the code naming semantics and improve the readability of the code
④ The author must go through the unit test to ensure the usability of the code
⑤ Typescript must be used completely to ensure code rigor and maintainability
⑥ If the code submitted by the writer conflicts, it must be resolved first. In pushing, GIT push - f origin branch is strictly prohibited
⑦ Put Vue code under Vue TS branch, react code under react TS branch and angular code under angular TS branch
:::

::: danger
Managers are not allowed to push or merge the code directly into the main branch. The main branch is only used to store the back-end code and document code. In this way, it avoids the need to wait for a long time to pull the code for the first time. After the code is written as a whole, it will be merged into the main branch
